# Post-Challenge 2: Birthday App

Your challenge is to build a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:
- wish the user happy birthday
- tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday

## Proposed screens:

Here are some suggested screens, but feel free to change the content, style and flow to make it your own.

<img alt="Birthday first page" src="./images/birthday_app_1.png" width="400px" style="display: block;" />
<img alt="Birthday greet" src="./images/birthday_app_3.png" width="400px" style="display: block;" />
<img alt="Birthday counter" src="./images/birthday_app_2.png" width="400px" style="display: block;" />
